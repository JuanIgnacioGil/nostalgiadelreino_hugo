>I am waiting for my case to come up  
and I am waiting  
for a rebirth of wonder  
and I am waiting for someone  
to really discover America  
and wail<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the discovery<br/>
of a new symbolic western frontier<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the American Eagle<br/>
to really spread its wings<br/>
and straighten up and fly right<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the Age of Anxiety<br/>
to drop dead<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the war to be fought<br/>
which will make the world safe<br/>
for anarchy<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the final withering away<br/>
of all governments<br/>
and I am perpetually awaiting<br/>
a rebirth of wonder</p>

>I am waiting for the Second Coming<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for a religious revival<br/>
to sweep thru the state of Arizona<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the Grapes of Wrath to be stored<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for them to prove<br/>
that God is really American<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
to see God on television<br/>
piped onto church altars<br/>
if only they can find<br/>
the right channel<br/>
to tune in on<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the Last Supper to be served again<br/>
with a strange new appetizer<br/>
and I am perpetually awaiting<br/>
a rebirth of wonder</p>

>I am waiting for my number to be called<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the Salvation Army to take over<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the meek to be blessed<br/>
and inherit the earth<br/>
without taxes<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for forests and animals<br/>
to reclaim the earth as theirs<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for a way to be devised<br/>
to destroy all nationalisms<br/>
without killing anybody<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for linnets and planets to fall like rain<br/>
and I am waiting for lovers and weepers<br/>
to lie down together again<br/>
in a new rebirth of wonder</p>

>I am waiting for the Great Divide to be crossed<br/>
and I am anxiously waiting<br/>
for the secret of eternal life to be discovered<br/>
by an obscure general practitioner<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the storms of life<br/>
to be over<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
to set sail for happiness<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for a reconstructed Mayflower<br/>
to reach America<br/>
with its picture story and tv rights<br/>
sold in advance to the natives<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the lost music to sound again<br/>
in the Lost Continent<br/>
in a new rebirth of wonder</p>

>I am waiting for the day<br/>
that maketh all things clear<br/>
and I am awaiting retribution<br/>
for what America did<br/>
to Tom Sawyer<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for Alice in Wonderland<br/>
to retransmit to me<br/>
her total dream of innocence<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for Childe Roland to come<br/>
to the final darkest tower<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for Aphrodite<br/>
to grow live arms<br/>
at a final disarmament conference<br/>
in a new rebirth of wonder</p>

>I am waiting<br/>
to get some intimations<br/>
of immortality<br/>
by recollecting my early childhood<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the green mornings to come again<br/>
youth’s dumb green fields come back again<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for some strains of unpremeditated art<br/>
to shake my typewriter<br/>
and I am waiting to write<br/>
the great indelible poem<br/>
and I am waiting<br/>
for the last long careless rapture<br/>
and I am perpetually waiting<br/>
for the fleeing lovers on the Grecian Urn<br/>
to catch each other up at last<br/>
and embrace<br/>
and I am awaiting<br/>
perpetually and forever<br/>
a renaissance of wonder
