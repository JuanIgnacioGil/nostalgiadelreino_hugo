<p><em><blockquote>Anyway, where humanity gets it wrong, in your time, is in imagining Atlantis as having any kind of quatifiable existence. Which of course it hasn&rsquo;t. Not in the way they imagine, anyway. There have been many Atlantises, and there will be quite a few more. It&rsquo;s just a symbol. A Symbol of the Art. The true Atlantis is inside you, just as it&rsquo;s inside all of us. The sunken land is lost beneath the dark sea, lost beneath the waves of wet, black stories and myths that break upon the shores of our minds. Atlantis is the shadow-land, the birth-place of civilization. The fair land in the west that is lost to us, but remains forever, true birthplace and true goal. It is Lyonesse, and Avalon, and Hy-Brasail.</blockquote></em><br/><br/><em>Neil Gaiman, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Magic">The Books of Magic</a></em></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1180118427259117074-3354690073812193779?l=nostalgiadelreino.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
