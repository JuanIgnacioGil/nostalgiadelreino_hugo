Stand ye calm and resolute,  
Like a forest close and mute,  
With folded arms and looks which are  
Weapons of unvanquished war.  
&nbsp;

And if then the tyrants dare,  
Let them ride among you there,  
Slash, and stab, and maim and hew,  
What they like, that let them do.  
&nbsp;

With folded arms and steady eyes, 
And little fear, and less surprise  
Look upon them as they slay  
Till their rage has died away  
&nbsp;

Then they will return with shame  
To the place from which they came,  
And the blood thus shed will speak  
In hot blushes on their cheek.  
&nbsp;

Rise like Lions after slumber  
In unvanquishable number,  
Shake your chains to earth like dew  
Which in sleep had fallen on you-  
Ye are many — they are few  
&nbsp;
